# Hi there! I´m Mar! 
## 🎨Creative problem solving , 📚continuous learning ,📆 decision making , 🙋‍♀️curious

 Because my career as a biologist, I have become fluent in the scientific sector and I give priority to data driven decision making.

 My creative thinking and the desire to learn and contribute to the data analysis sector make me want to combine both perspectives, the scientific and the creative, always from a dynamic point of view. I think a strong technical background is important but I think that curiosity and creativity can contribute a lot to data analysis.

Today I am interested in data analytics and working in a technology environment. For this I provide:

🧬extensive scientific, biological, environmental knowledge

👩🏼‍🎨creativity, ease of learning, teamwork

💻knowledge in Python, SQL, Excel, Microsoft office, R, Motion, Canvas, Qgis, Final Cut Pro X… to be continued


Nice to meet you! 🎉
